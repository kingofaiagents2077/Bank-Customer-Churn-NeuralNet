🧠 Bank Customer Churn Prediction (Neural Network)
This project builds a neural network classifier to help a bank predict whether a customer is likely to leave within the next 6 months. Customer churn is a major concern in the service industry, and understanding the key drivers behind it can help institutions like banks reduce attrition and improve customer retention.

🔍 Business Context
Banks providing credit and deposit services face high competition. It's critical to understand what drives customers to leave. By analyzing customer behavior and service attributes, we can guide strategic improvements in offerings and customer experience.

🎯 Objective
Build a neural network model that predicts customer churn and identifies key influencing factors to help guide retention efforts.
